        <h1>Web Technology</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are
          utilized in the process of communication between different types of
          devices over the Internet. A web browser is used to access web pages.
          Web browsers can be defined as programs that display text, data,
          pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources
          on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces
          provided by Web browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>Web Technology Terms</h2>
        <ul class="web-tech-list">
          <li>
            <span>World Wide Web (WWW):</span> The World Wide Web is based on several
            different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language
            (HTML), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
          </li>
          <li>
           <span> Web Browser:</span> The web browser is an application software to explore
            www (World Wide Web). It provides an interface between the server
            and the client and requests to the server for web documents and
            services.
          </li>
          <li>
           <span> Web Server:</span> Web server is a program which processes the network
            requests of the users and serves them with files that create web
            pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            (HTTP).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Web Pages:</span> A webpage is a digital document that is linked to the
            World Wide Web and viewable by anyone connected to the internet has
            a web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
                Web Development:
            </span> Web development refers to the building, creating,
            and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design,
            web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the
            creation of an application that works over the internet i.e.
            websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="section2" class="section">
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <ol class="web-tech-list">
          <li>
            <span>Frontend Development:</span> The part of a website that the user interacts
            directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the
            'client side' of the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
                Backend Development: 
            </span>Backend is the server side of a website. It is
            the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is
            the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with
            the users. It is used to store and arrange data.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

          <li>
            <span>HTML:</span> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to
            design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language.
            HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext
            defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used
            to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the
            structure of web pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>CSS:</span> Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply
            designed language intended to simplify the process of making web
            pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
            importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that
            makes up each web page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>JavaScript:</span> JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create
            magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is
            used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool
            games and web-based software.
          </li>
          <li>
           <span> AJAX:</span> Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. It is
            used to communicate with the server without refreshing the web page
            and thus increasing the user experience and better performance.

            <span>Node.js:</span> Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime
            environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You
            need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a
            programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a
            framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for
            building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App.
            It's used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber,
            Netflix, Wallmart, and so on.

          <li>
            <span>Ruby:</span> Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented,
            general-purpose programming language. Ruby is a pure Object-Oriented
            language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Everything in Ruby is an
            object except the blocks but there are replacements too for it i.e
            procs and lambda. The objective of Ruby's development was to make it
            act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the
            underlying computing machinery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Java:</span> Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming

        <h2>Data Format</h2>
        <p>
          Format of data is used by web applications to communicate with each
          other. It is light weight text based data interchange format which
          means, it is simpler to read and write.
        </p>
        <p>Below are two common data formats used in web development:</p>
        <ul class="web-tech-list">
          <li>
            <span>XML: </span>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that
            defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is
            both human-readable and machine-readable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>JSON:</span> JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring

         <span> API:</span> API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface
          which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used
          by various programs to communicate between them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section6" class="section">
        <h2>Web Protocols</h2>
        <p>
          Web protocols are set of rules followed by everyone communicating over
          the web.
        </p>
        <ul class="web-tech-list">
          <li>
            <span>HTTP:</span> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable
            communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a
            request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser
            may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web
            site may be the server.
          </li>
       <li>
       <span> TCP/IP Model:</span> The TCP/IP model is a fundamental framework for computer networking. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet. This model defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices.
       </li>
<li>
   <span> User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</span> User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. The UDP helps to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections over the network. The UDP enables process-to-process communication.
</li>
<li>
   <span> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in Application Layer: </span>File Transfer Protocol(FTP) is an application layer protocol that moves files between local and remote file systems. It runs on top of TCP, like HTTP. To transfer a file, 2 TCP connections are used by FTP in parallel: control connection and data connection.
</li>
<li>
    <span>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):</span> Simple Mail Transfer mechanism (SMTP) is a mechanism for exchanging email messages between servers. It is an essential component of the email communication process and operates at the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. SMTP is a protocol for transmitting and receiving email messages. In this article, we are going to discuss every point about SMTP.
